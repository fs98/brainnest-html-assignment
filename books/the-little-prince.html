    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
      <b>The Little Prince</b> (French: Le Petit Prince, pronounced [lә p(ә)ti pᴚἕS]) is a novella by French aristocrat,
      writer, and military aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in English and French in the
      United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation;
      Saint-Exupéry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various
      planets in space, including Earth, and address themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style
      as a children's book, <i>The Little Prince</i> makes observations about life, adults and human nature.
