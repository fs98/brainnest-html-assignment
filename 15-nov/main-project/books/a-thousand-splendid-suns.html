    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
      <b>A Thousand Splendid Suns</b> is a 2007 novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini, following the huge
      success of his bestselling 2003 debut <i>The Kite Runner</i>. Mariam, an illegitimate teenager from Herat, is
      forced to marry a shoemaker from Kabul after a family tragedy. Laila, born a generation later, lives a relatively
      privileged life, but her life intersects with Mariam's when a similar tragedy forces her to accept a marriage
      proposal from Mariam's husband.
