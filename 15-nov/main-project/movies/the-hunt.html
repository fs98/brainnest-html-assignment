    <!-- Title -->
    <h1>The Hunt</h1>

    <!-- Description -->
    <p><b>The Hunt</b> is a 2020 American horror thriller film[a] directed by Craig Zobel and written by Nick Cuse and
      Damon Lindelof. The film stars Betty Gilpin, Ike Barinholtz, Emma Roberts, and Hilary Swank. Jason Blum was a
      producer under his Blumhouse Productions banner, along with Lindelof.[4] The film is about a group of high income
      liberal people who kidnap working class people with conservative political views to hunt them for sport. Zobel and
      Lindelof have said that the film is intended as a satire on the profound political divide between the American
      left and right.</p>

    <p>The film was first announced in March 2018, and the cast signed on a year later. Filming took place in New
      Orleans. The film was originally scheduled for release on September 27, 2019. However, as a result of the Dayton
      and El Paso mass shootings in early August 2019, Universal Pictures decided to delay it.</p>
